This project endeavors to automate the deployment of a 3-tier web application in AWS utilizing CloudFormation while concurrently monitoring the infrastructure using CloudWatch. The proposed solution includes the design and implementation of a CloudFormation template to define the necessary infrastructure, which comprises three distinct layers - the presentation, application, and database layer - all of which will be deployed in separate Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) to ensure optimal security and isolation. The presentation layer consists of an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer and Amazon EC2 instances that will run a web server, while the application layer comprises Amazon EC2 instances responsible for hosting application servers that will collaborate with the presentation layer to deliver required functionalities to end-users. On the other hand, the database layer entails an Amazon RDS instance responsible for storing data that the application servers utilize. Following deployment, CloudWatch will be deployed to monitor the infrastructure by setting up CloudWatch alarms to notify the team in the event of predefined threshold exceedances, for example, CPU utilization, memory utilization, network throughput, and disk usage. Ultimately, this approach will allow for proactive infrastructure monitoring and management, ensuring the web application's availability and optimal performance.
