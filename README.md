# AWS-Project
I have had an incredible experience during my CDAC training, where I led a team of 5 members to develop a 3-tier infrastructure using CloudFormation on AWS. We tackled various challenges while working on templates and YAML files, but our unwavering teamwork, dedication, and attention to detail propelled us to success.
